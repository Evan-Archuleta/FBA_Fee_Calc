This project is to calculate Amazon FBA fulfilment fees given the items weight and dimensions. This calculator is for non-apparel items at this time, but a future version may include an apparel calculator. This calculator also is not for hazardous goods. Both hazardous goods and apparel are charged differently. A future version might incorporate these. 

The CSV loaded in should have five columns: sku, longest-side, median-side, shortest-side, item-package-weight. The units should be in lbs and inches. This file should be named "sku_info.csv".
