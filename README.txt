This project is to calculate Amazon FBA fulfilment fees given the items weight and dimensions. This calculator is for non-apparel items at this time, but a future version may include an apparel calculator. 

The CSV loaded in should have five columns: sku, longest-side, median-side, shortest-side, item-package-weight. The units should be in lbs and inches.
